# One Time Pad- One Step Down

Goal- to make a One Time Pad inspired encryption app that is only one step down from the absolute security that a properly implemented OTP has. Why? Because the OTP method is not easy to pull off in real life, a single veer from the strict requirements ruins the absolute security. So this custom encryption  app aims to make otp usage LESS hard on the user, and just go one step down. Being one step down, it is not perfect security, but its pretty dam close.
